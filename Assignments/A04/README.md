## üìù Orientation Attendance Note

- Attended a technical orientation focused on **robotic arms** and **angle expansion**.
- The presenter gave a **live demonstration** showing how robotic arms interact with different **geometric shapes**.
- Observed how angles are expanded and adjusted to allow precise shape manipulation.
- Learned about **rotation, alignment, and motion control** in robotic arms.
- The session connected **geometry and trigonometry** concepts to real-world robotic movement.
- Gained a better understanding of how programming logic is applied to mechanical design.
